            <p class="text-left h4">1. Leave your bandage/wrap on until told by your artist.</p>
            <p class="text-left">   -While some artists may ask you to leave your bandage on for only an hour, 
                others may ask you to keep it on for a whole day. 
                Your tattoo artist knows which length of time is best for you and your ink, 
                so ensure you listen to their advice.</p>

            <p class="text-left h4">2. Wash your tattoo well after removing the bandage/wrap. </p>
            <p class="text-left">   -Wash your tattoo thoroughly (but carefully) using warm water and
                 an unscented and alcohol-free soap to remove any excess dried blood and plasma.</p>

            <p class="text-left h4">3. Pat your tattoo dry after cleaning it.</p>
            <p class="text-left">-Use a clean paper towel to dry your tattoo by gently patting the area. Do not rub.</p>

            <p class="text-left h4">4. Apply a thin layer of lotion.</p>
            <p class="text-left">-After cleaning your tattoo, ensure the area is completely dry before applying a very 
                thin layer of your chosen tattoo aftercare lotion to help moisturize and nourish the area.</p> 

            <p class="text-left h4">5. Repeat the cleaning process until the tattoo is fully healed.</p>
            <p class="text-left">-Remember that your tattoo isn’t completely safe from germs and bacteria until it has completely 
                finished scabbing and peeling. Continue to wash the tattoo until this point (usually 2-4 weeks).</p>

            <p class="text-left h4">6. Don’t pick and pull at the flaking/scabbing skin.</p>
            <p class="text-left">-Picking away at your healing tattoo can delay healing, cause fading, and increase the chances of infection.</p>

            <p class="text-left h4">7. Stay away from the sun.</p>
            <p class="text-left">-Don’t expose your new tattoo to intense sunlight and don’t 
                apply any sun lotion to the area until it has fully healed.</p> 

            <p class="text-left h4">8. Stay away from water.</p>
            <p class="text-left">-All bodies of water can contain nasty bacteria that can ruin a new tattoo if you’re not careful.
                 Stick to short showers until your skin has fully healed, and don’t go swimming.</p> 

            <p class="text-left h4">9. Continue to look after your tattoo.</p>
            <p class="text-left">-Once healed, keep your tattoo well protected from the sun and
                 ensure you continue to moisturize the area regularly. Healthy skin means a healthy-looking tattoo.</p>
